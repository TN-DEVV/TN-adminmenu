# USAGE

/duty to on/off admin duty

/atag to toggle on/off the admin tag above the head

# UPDATE V1.0.0

+ Completly reworked the script
+ Added a admin tag above the admin head. (Can be enabled with /atag command)
+ Changed command /adminduty to /duty
+ Added config.lua where you can change everything

# NOTE

If you want to change the logo above the admin head, go to the stream folder and open the logo.ytd. Then change to logo inside of it.

*WARNING*
If you change the .png name in the logo.ytd file, you should also change the logo name in config.lua too!!!
